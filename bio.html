                <p>Born in Florida, grew up in Arizona.  I went to a Jesuit High School & College and knew early on I wanted to pursue a career in finance.  I worked in the finance industry from 1996 until 2017 trading, modeling, selling and structuring solutions for institutional clients.  In 2017 I started working for a medical device startup that is focused on noninvasive ways to detect blood glucose, and am currently working part time as a business development lead, project manager and data analyst for a dermatologist practice in Stamford, CT where we are also focused on noninvasive solutions to treat skin cancer.</p>
